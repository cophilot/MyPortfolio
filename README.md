Welcome to my portfolio website. This website is a showcase for my projects and a playground for new technologies. It is built with Angular and hosted on GitHub Pages.The website is available at [portfolio.philipp-bonin.com](https://portfolio.philipp-bonin.com).

The website consists of two components:

## Desktop Version

The desktop version is the main version of the website. You will be automatically redirected to this version if you are using a desktop device, if not you can access it [here](https://portfolio.philipp-bonin.com/#/desktop/force).
This version shows all projects in a dock on the bottom of the screen. You can click on a project to open it in a new window. The window can be moved and resized. The window also has a close button and a maximize button.

## Mobile Version

The mobile version is a simplified version of the website. You will be automatically redirected to this version if you are using a mobile device, if not you can access it [here](https://portfolio.philipp-bonin.com/#/mobile/force).
This version shows all projects in a grid. You can click on a project to open it in a new window.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.7.
